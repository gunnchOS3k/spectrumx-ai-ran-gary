# Gary Micro-Twin Configuration
# 
# Focused 3-zone model for controlled ML testing:
# - Gary City Hall (civic center, moderate traffic)
# - West Side Leadership Academy (high school, variable occupancy)
# - Gary Public Library & Cultural Center (community hub, steady baseline)
#
# This micro-twin produces zone-aware synthetic IQ and metadata for ML testing.
# It does NOT replace SpectrumX competition data - it's a controlled extension.
