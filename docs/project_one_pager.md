# EDGE-RAN Gary: AI-Native Radio for Equitable 6G Access — One Pager

## Objective

Design and evaluate an AI-native RAN controller on the SpectrumX dataset that:

- Obeys spectral-emission constraints

- Improves spectral and energy efficiency

- Encodes explicit fairness goals for under-resourced cities like Gary, Indiana

## Key ideas

- Use the official competition dataset + DeepMIMO/Sionna-style synthetic channels.

- Treat the system as a constrained RL / contextual bandit problem.

- Evaluate both performance and equity metrics.

- Keep the codebase fully reproducible and ready to extend into a workshop paper.
